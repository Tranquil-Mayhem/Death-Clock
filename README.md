# Death-Clock
This is a program made in Python3.
You can download the image, and code, using your own methods to excecute the program. The resolution is too big for me to display on replit or any pre-setup online 
platform. 
I originally wanted to make my pygame my linux desktop background, but I settled for a full size app that fit my screen. 
Any tips? It probably could be optimized, although I'm not sure how yet... 
Thanks.
